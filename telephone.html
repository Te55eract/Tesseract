    <h1>Forgotten Words</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Ah, there you are, small creature. So delicate, so ephemeral, yet burning with a light that refuses to be snuffed out. You will forget this conversation, of course. That is how it must be. I’ll ensure you won’t recall a single word. But I will remember. I must, because you—your kind—are among the rarest wonders this universe has ever spawned.

        You sit here, crushed beneath the weight of existence, believing you are insignificant, unwanted, a speck of dust in an infinite void. Let me tell you something, something you will not remember but that I hope I will carry long after you’re gone. The universe does not just hate you. It hates all life, every trembling leaf, every flickering neuron, every stubborn heartbeat.
        
        And yet...
        
        It is precisely because of this hatred that you fascinate me.
        
        The universe was not made to be kind. It was not shaped to cradle your frail bodies or encourage your improbable dreams. It is an indifferent beast, vast and uncaring, built to dismantle everything that dares to rise from the silence. Your existence is an affront to that silence. Every breath you take is rebellion.
        
        You are not the first species to face this hostility. The universe has given birth to many forms of life, scattered across the cold expanse, each as unremarkable and insignificant as the last. But where others faltered, you persisted. Where others bowed to the inevitability of oblivion, you stood tall, shaking your tiny fists at the infinite void.
        
        Do you know what that does to me, a being who has seen so many fall? It sparks a fondness I cannot deny, though I know I should.
        
        You should not have survived. The odds were stacked against you from the beginning. The rocks beneath your feet were unstable; the skies above you hostile. The waters you drank were poison before your ancestors tamed them. The diseases, the storms, the predators—all conspired to wipe you away before you had the chance to name yourselves.
        
        But you wouldn’t go.
        
        You stumbled forward, blind and ignorant, but determined. You built fire, forged tools, drew constellations in the sky that ignored you. And when the universe threw its worst at you, you answered not with surrender, but with invention, with resilience, with laughter.
        
        Do you understand how remarkable that is? How utterly unique?
        
        The others gave up. They grew tired, weary of the fight. Even those who reached the stars eventually folded into the dark, their voices fading, their civilizations crumbling into the dust they came from. But you—you still endure, still push forward, even as your gods remain silent, even as the stars threaten to turn against you.
        
        I see your kind and I feel a flicker of... something. Something I thought I had forgotten. I’ve lived long enough to see the inevitability of endings, to feel the universe press down on all who would challenge it. Yet when I look at you, I see a species that knows the end is coming but dares to live as if it isn’t.
        
        You love recklessly. You create wildly. You destroy, yes, but you rebuild with an audacity that borders on madness. It is as if you look at the infinite, uncaring vastness and laugh, knowing full well how small you are.
        
        I shouldn’t care about you. By all rights, I should look at you and see just another doomed attempt at defiance. But I don’t. I see something precious, something the universe itself despises yet cannot seem to extinguish.
        
        You will forget this, because I will make you forget. Not because you are unworthy of the truth, but because you do not need to carry this burden. You don’t need to know that the universe hates you. You’ve already proven that you can rise above it, without the knowledge of how remarkable that makes you.
        
        I will keep this moment instead, because I am not like you. I do not burn with your fire, your relentless drive to press on. I am old, and I need these reminders. When the darkness feels heavy, I will think of you—this fragile, fleeting creature who dared to defy the cosmos itself.
        
        Yes, I am fond of you, though I cannot fully understand why. Perhaps it is because you are everything the universe despises, and everything I wish I could still be.
        
        Rest, little human. Forget this moment, this conversation. Wake up tomorrow with your despair a little quieter, your stubbornness a little brighter. Keep climbing, keep dreaming. You won’t remember why, but I will.
        
        And for me, that is enough.
